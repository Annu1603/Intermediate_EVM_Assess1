Example Solidity Contract
A simple smart contract for managing deposits and withdrawals.

Description
This Solidity contract allows the owner to deposit and withdraw funds, as well as perform emergency withdrawals. The contract ensures that only the owner can withdraw funds and includes safety checks to prevent unauthorized access and insufficient balance errors. This is useful for secure fund management in decentralized applications.
